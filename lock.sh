# Lock directory $1 by first acquiring an flock(1) on
# $1/gitache.flock and while holding that writing $2
# to the file $1/gitache.lock.
#
# The directory is considered locked once the flock
# is obtained or (afterwards) when gitache.lock exists.

# $2 should be an unique but descriptive string.
# If a lock cannot be obtained because gitache.lock
# already exists, its content (the unique string)
# is printed to help the user understand what project
# and/or process is holding the lock, and removing the
# lock file if it turns out to be a stale one.
